The Weather Forecast Application is a web-based app that allows users to check the current weather and get forecasts for the upcoming days. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and dynamically displays the information on the site.

## Importance of the Application
User Assistance: The application provides accurate weather information, helping users plan their daily activities.
Educational: The app can be used as an educational project to learn how to use APIs and handle dynamic data.
Technological Advancement: Enhances programming and design skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
